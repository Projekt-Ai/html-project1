      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Christiaan Thomas, but most refer to me with Kailani or Kai. My family is from Jamaica, 
		but I was born and spent most of my life in Jacksonville. I was originally an Electrical Engineering student
		at UNF but currently pursue a degree in Information Technology. My reason for the switch involved the fact
		the only course I truly enjoyed my first year being Programming 1, as well as the fact I would be partially
		correct in saying learning physics sent me to the hospital. </p>
