      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Christiaan Thomas, but most refer to me with Kailani or Kai. My family is from Jamaica, 
		but I was born and spent most of my life in Jacksonville. I was originally an Electrical Engineering student
		at UNF but currently pursue a degree in Information Technology. My reason for the switch involved the fact
		the only course I truly enjoyed my first year being Programming 1, as well as the fact I would be partially
		correct in saying learning physics sent me to the hospital. </p>
      <p>I currently work with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Black_Men_of_America" target="_blank">100 Black Men</a> under their 
		Mayor's Youth at Work partnership. Since February 2022 I've been working with them as an intern for a number of tasks. Currently,
		we have gotten into the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>, 
		particularly for the sake of automation. Apart from this, I've also done a number of 3D art and composition projects.</p>

		<p>During summers I sometimes go to a Christian youth camp in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapelton,_Jamaica" target="_blank">Chapelton, Jamaica</a>
		to volunteer. I'm not too good with children so I often end up being a general assistant for the directors of the camp, but a few years ago
		I did work with a group to teach music and perform at the end of the week.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      		<p>My primary hobby has always been gaming, from having nothing more than a kindle playing gameboy emulators to
			a laptop built especially for running high graphics video game content. But really, most of my favourites
			have had a tendency to be titles played on Nintendo's Switch console. My all time favourite being the
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles" target="_blank">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series, particularly 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_(video_game)" target="_blank">one</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoblade_Chronicles_3" target="_blank">three</a>.
			I have yet find time to play the other two in the series, but they are somewhere on my list. Other games I've been enjoying recently are detective-style stories such as
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Detective:_The_Secret_Salami" target="_blank">Duck Detective</a>, party-based roleplaying games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor:_ReFantazio" target="_blank">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>,
			and pure action games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn" target="_blank">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>.
			</p>
      		<p>But recently I've really gotten into building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpla" target="_blank">Gunpla</a>, or gundam model kits. 
			It was become a time consuming yet relaxing hobby if I need to forget about the world for a few hours. My most recent build has been a Barbatos Lupus,
			but my absolute favourite to work on was the Mazinger Zero Infinitism I found at hobby lobby on sale seen in the middle below. As seen in the image it is noticeably larger compared to 
			my other simpler builds.
